For this course, we will be using [CMake](https://cmake.org) to configure our build environment for proper compilation across different platforms. We will add each lab/assignment/exam as a subdirectory into a single project to allow all of the projects to be visible in the same IDE window.

## Getting Started

Download [CS370\_Fa23.zip](CS370_Fa23.zip), saving it into the directory where you plan on placing all your CS370 projects. **Note: BE SURE THE PATH DOES NOT CONTAIN ANY SPACES.**

Double-click on **CS370\_Fa23.zip** and extract the contents of the archive into a subdirectory called **CS370\_Fa23**

Open CLion, select **Open** from the main screen (you may need to close any open projects), and navigate to the **CS370\_Fa23** directory. This should open the project and execute the CMake script to configure the toolchain.

## Windows

In the popup dialog, in the **Toolchain** drop down select Visual Studio

Then select **Manage toolchains**

> <img src="img/CLion2.png" alt="Windows CLion Toolchain Dialog" height="500"/>

In the toolchain dialog, be sure Visual Studio is selected, then in the **Architecture:** dropdown, choose **amd64**

> <img src="img/CLion3.png" alt="Windows CLion Architecture Dialog" height="500"/>

Then click **OK** to exit the dialog boxes. This will set Visual Studio x64 as the compiler for all the projects we'll be importing into this project folder for this course.

Next select **File -> Settings** from the menubar.

> <img src="img/CLionSettings.png" alt="CLion Select Settings Window" height="400"/>

In the **Settings** dialog, select the **Tools->Terminal** option, then replace what is in the **Shell path:** setting with

    "C:\cygwin64\bin\sh" -lic 'cd "${OLDPWD-.}"; bash'

> <img src="img/CLionTerminal.png" alt="CLion Tools Settings Window" height="500"/>

If everything is configured correctly, when you select the **Terminal** tab in the lower left corner of CLion it should open up a terminal pane that displays a Cygwin prompt in the **CS370-Fall2022** project directory.

## Mac OSX

In the popup dialog, in the **Toolchain** drop down simply leave the default for Mac OSX which will use the XCode Clang compiler for all the projects we'll be importing into this project folder.

CLion will also simply use the built-in OSX Terminal application.
